Text App Comments

First I'd like to start by saying this was a fun challenging class. I've never used or even heard of terminal, github or phoneGap. So, this was all knew and difficult
Thanks to the help of Dulce, I've managed to scrap by when it came to push origin master or git check out (and so on). Originally I thought creating this app wouldn't
be as hard but the more we got into it, the more difficult it was. Creating the html and css was a breeze. Javascript? Whole different story. I suck at javascript like
you cannot believe. I'm suprised I even managed to create something to be honest. 
That being said, using plugins seemed impossible. Easy at first but adding the javascript. No way. Not happening. I tired and tried but could not get the stupid thing 
work. Even Dulce tried and no help. So my battery thing doenst work at least I don't think so. But everthing seemed to work
